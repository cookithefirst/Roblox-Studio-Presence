# 🛠️ Roblox-Studio-Presence [ v1 ]
**Roblox Studio Presence** is a *teeny-tiny* little Node.js tool that makes your discord profile just a **whooole** lot ***dev-ier***!
*(If that's even a word..) (No it isn't.)*

## 🛠️ Features
### **🔁 Easy setup**
The setup can be as small as **installing node.js** and clicking on that **installation.bat** file!
### **✨ Beautiful design**

### **📈 Frequent Updates**
I will continuously update **RSP** whenever I have some cool ideas for it in stock! :100:

## 🔽 Installation
### 0️⃣ Install Node.js
If you haven't already, install Node.js with [🔗 this link](https://nodejs.org/).
### 1️⃣ Install RobloxStudioPresence.zip
To install it, just download the [**latest release**](https://github.com/cookithefirst/Roblox-Studio-Presence/releases/tag/Release)!<br>
<sup>🔗 Alternatively, click on **<> Code** then **📁 Download Zip** in the repository's page.</sup>
### 2️⃣ Extract The ZIP File
This can be done by **right clicking** on the file, and then **Extract All**.
### 3️⃣ Installation.bat
Just open **Installation.bat**, and wait until all dependencies are installed.
Then, exit the window.
### 4️⃣ config.json
Head over to the **config.json** file, inside, you'll find a "clientid" key, with an empty value.
Supply this value with the application id of a new application you'll make called 'Roblox Studio'.<br>
<sup>🔗 Create an application by going to [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and clicking on "New Application". Add the name and then you'll find Application ID at the General Information tab.</sup>
### 5️⃣ Start.bat
Finally, open **Start.bat** and wait until **RSP** starts running.
You can exit the window now, since **RSP** now works in the background.
