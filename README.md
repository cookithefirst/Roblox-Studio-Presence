# 🛠️ Roblox-Studio-Presence [ v1 ]
**Roblox Studio Presence** is a *teeny-tiny* little Node.js tool that makes your discord profile just a **whooole** lot ***dev-ier***!
*(If that's even a word..) (No it isn't.)*

## 🛠️ Features

The setup can be as small as **installing node.js** and clicking on that **installation.bat** file!
### **✨ Beautiful design**
